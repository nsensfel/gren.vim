# gren.vim

A (very basic) Vim plugin for [the Gren programming language](https://gren-lang.org/).
Just install it with your favourite plugin manager or copy the files manually (there's just two of them) and you should have `.gren`-file detection and some basic syntax highlighting, courtesy of the `syntax/elm.vim`-file, which I just modified slightly.

Hopefully I'll have time and energy to spend some more time fleshing this out, because Gren seems amazing, but I've barely gotten to touch the language for  𝒓 𝒆 𝒂 𝒔 𝒐 𝒏 𝒔~*, but this takes one hurdle away at least :3
